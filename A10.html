    <p>My name is Bradley Peatross.  I gew-up in Utah, West Jordan mostly.  I went
    to High School at Copper Hills before I joined the Marine Corps.</p>
    <p> In the Marines,
    after boot-camp, Marine Combat Training, and MOS School I was sent to Okinawa,
    Japan.  From there I deployed to various other locations to include Iraq durring
    2004 when fighting was the fiercest and Saddam Huessein was captured.  As well as
    other more enjoyable locations such as Austrailia and Thailand as well as others.
    My job in the Marines was a Tactical Network Specialist, I helped with most Tactical
    IT gear on deployments as well as support garrision infrustruture. Which helped
    me further my career after the Marines in IT as a contractor with the government
    and then as a government civilian where I am currently employed at Hill AFB.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've always been interested in technology and it has helped me with my career
      but, I can't always go in the path that I want, because I have to choose to
      most stable path for myself and my family.  That being said I have always had
      interest in Artificial Intelligence, but I haven't had the chance to dedicate
      to this path.  Now I'm going back to school for a Computer Scince degree with
      a plan to pursue follow on research in an institute or environment that would
      be conducive to this technology.  And maybe one day working in this field.

    <p>While I lived in Japan I went to school to learn Japanese as well as spent
    my time dating local Japanese girls to practice my Japanese.</p>
    <p>Durring this time I had a few girl friends, but stayed with and later married
    my wife now.  Together we had three kids together, two boys and one girl</p>
    <p>While living in Japan I wanted my kids to grow up in America where the economy
    is better than Japan and where we could live in more acomidating houses then the
    small apartments or small houses that are common in Japan.  So I looked for a Job in
    America, worked on my wifes VISA and moved back.</p>

  <h3 id="hobbies" class="headers">Hobbies</h3>
  <div class="hobbies">
    <div class="panel">
    <p>I work full time, go to school full time and I have a family so my free time is very limited, but in those times I enjoy hiking with my family, listening to audio books, watching T.V. Playing sports like Soccer or BaseBall, teaching my kids different technologies, and playing games with my family</p>
    <p>Since my family and I have moved to Utah the Rocky Mountains have been a very drastic difference from the tropical island of Okinawa from where we moved from.  The mountains are beautiful, just like the oceans are beautiful on Okinawa.  We frequently hike different trails and enjoy the excersice, nature and the views.</p>
    <p>I also enjoy sharing my interest in technology with my kids.  I have taught my oldest the beginings of Java and Python and we build projects together on a raspberry pi, we have only done simple projects so far and it is fun.</p>
    <p>My Kids and I have always been interested in Soccer and we play together as well as on teams when we have the chance.  The numerous parks in Utah have been great for this as well.  When we are tired of Soccer its alwasy fun to throw around a baseball too.</p>
    <p>Interest in technology frequently overlapps into video games and I have setup three networked computers in my house so that we can all play games together, this has proven to be very fun for all, we just have to keep a watch on the time.</p>
    <p>When relaxing I enjoy watching T.V. and listening to audio books.  This is wonderful when I want to be quiet and be as lazy as possible as well as spark my imagination</p>

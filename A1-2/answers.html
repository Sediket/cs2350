<h1>Internet Questions</h1>
<h2>Bradley Peatross</h2>
<h3>What is the difference between TCP/IP and HTTP?</h3>
<p>
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.
  TCP/IP is the most popular form of modern networking between capable devices,
	for example computers or phones when accessing the internet; TCP/IP establishes
	 a suite of protocols and rules for this networking. 
</p>
<h3> Define the term: URL?</h3>
<p>
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator and are commonly used to location web sites
or ftp or email addresses, but can be used for referencing pretty much anything.  An
example would be: http://www.google.com/index.html which is connecting to the server
at www.google.com and the filename index.html.
</p>
<h3>What is the Client/Server Model?</h3>
<p>
The client/server model is the basis for sharing of information on networks.
Typically the server will be hosting information, information that will be 
available for clients to access.  This communication is initiated by clients
when they request for this information from the server, then is shared.
